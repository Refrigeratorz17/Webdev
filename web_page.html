        <h2>What is Honkai Star Rail? ( ╹ -╹)?</h2>
        <p><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> is a free to play role-playing game with aspects of space 
            and fantasy. What makes it special is its turn-based combat, 
            an adventure driven story, exploration of several worlds, battling enemies,
            solving puzzles, and uncovering mysteries of the universe. </p>
        <h4>Gameplay</h4>
        <p>Honkai: Star Rail's gameplay combines exploration of many worlds with strategic turn-based 
            combat. During combat you have options to select certain actions, such as
            basic attacks, skills, and ultimates. You manage team composition, skill points, and 
            character roles. The player builds a team of four characters, each with unique abilities and stories.
            Each character belongs to a specific combat type and path, which define their roles
            in combat. </p>
        <h4>Story</h4>
        <p>The player takes on the role of the Trailblazer, a character experiencing a
            total loss of memory, who travels the galaxy on the Astral Express(a spaceship).
            The story involves uncovering secrets of worlds, learning and meeting characters,
            solving conflicts of stories, and experiencing the dark and light moments.</p>

        <h2>Why I like it! ദ്ദി(˵ •̀ ᴗ - ˵ ) </h2>
        <p>I like Honkai: Star Rail for an abundence of reasons. The combat is exactly my cup of tea,
            playing a turn-based game gives me time to strategize in between turns and evaluate my team, 
            actions, and more. My mind tends to get overwhelmed when playing real-time games, 
            so being able to play Honkai: Star Rail is relaxing and fun for me instead of 
            stressful or confusing.
