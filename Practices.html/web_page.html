        <h2><u>What is Honkai Star Rail?</u> ( ╹ -╹)?</h2>
        <p><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> is a free to play role-playing game with aspects of space 
            and fantasy. What makes it special is its turn-based combat, 
            an adventure driven story, exploration of several worlds, battling enemies,
            solving puzzles, and uncovering mysteries of the universe.</p>
        <a href="https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Honkai:_Star_Rail_Wiki" target="_blank" id="wiki">Honkai: Star Rail Wiki</a>
        <h4>Gameplay</h4>
        <p>Honkai: Star Rail's gameplay combines exploration of many worlds with strategic turn-based 
            combat. During combat you have options to select certain actions, such as
            basic attacks, skills, and ultimates. You manage team composition, skill points, and 
            character roles. The player builds a team of four characters, each with unique abilities and stories.
            Each character belongs to a specific combat type and path, which define their roles
            in battle.</p>
        <h4>Story</h4>
        <p>The player takes on the role of the Trailblazer, a character experiencing a
            total loss of memory, who travels the galaxy on the Astral Express(a spaceship).
            The story involves uncovering secrets of worlds, learning and meeting characters,
            solving conflicts of stories, and experiencing the dark and light moments.</p>

        <h4>Gacha Sytem</h4>
        <p>If you don't know already, a gacha game uses a 'gacha' or a 'loot box' mechanic to reward the player
            with randomized virtual items such as charcters and equipment. You use in game currency that can
            be earned through gameplay or purchased with real money to preform 'pulls' that give a random reward. 
            The gacha system whithin Honkai: Star Rail is called the Warp, where players use Stellar Jades(the ingame currency)
            to pull for characters or Light Cones(weapons). It features a pity system that guarentees a 5-star
            item after a certain amount of pulls. It also features different banners with limited-time characters
            and some permanent standard banners.</p>
        <h4>Honkai series</h4>
        <p>The Hoyoverse(global entertainment brand and publishing subsidiary of the Chinese
            company miHoYo) Honkai series is a shared multiverse of games developed by miHoY,
            these games, along with other related media, are connected through a shared cosmology(The
            scientific study of the origin, development, structure and future of the entire universe)
            but take place in seperate worlds. The main games in the "Honkai" series are</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Honkai Impact 3rd</li>
            <li>Honkai: Star Rail</li>
            <li>Honkai: Nexus Anima(in development)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Other Hoyoverse games</h4>
        <p>If you've ever heard of Hoyoverse, you've probably heard of Genshin Impact. I won't
            go into much detail about it, but it is Hoyoverse's other popular game, an action
            role-playing game that features an open world environment and an action-based, real-time
            battle system. Genshin Impact is apart of the Honkai universe, both games exist and are
            considered seperate leaves on the imaginary tree. They are seperate worlds, though they share
            common lore and narrative framework, some theorize a potential link between the two games
            stating that Star Rail serves as a future narrative direction for Genshin. Here is a list of Hoyoverse's most known games. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Genhsin Impact</li>
            <li>Honkai: Star Rail</li>
            <li>Honkai Impact 3rd</li>
            <li>Zenless Zone Zero</li>
            <li>Tears of Themis</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><u>Why I like it!</u> ദ്ദി(˵ •̀ ᴗ - ˵ ) </h2>
        <p>I like Honkai: Star Rail for an abundence of reasons. The combat is exactly my cup of tea,
            playing a turn-based game gives me time to strategize in between turns and evaluate my team, 
            actions, and more. My mind tends to get overwhelmed when playing real-time games, 
            so being able to play Honkai: Star Rail is relaxing and fun for me instead of 
            stressful or confusing.</p>
        <p>I also really enjoy the story and characters. I have played many games by the same company
            and many others, yet for some reason Honkai: Star Rail's story catches my attention. 
            I love the stories of each individual character, the character design, and so much more. 
            Overall It's just a really great game and if any of these aspects catch your attention try it</p>
            out!</p>
