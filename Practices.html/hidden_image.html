    <h2>Why cats?</h2>
    <p>A cat is a domesticated, small, carnivorous mammil kept as a pet, known for its agility, soft fur 
        and hunting instincts. At the moment I have three cats, Shadow is our Calico cat that has dark fur 
        with some brown spots. And Lila is our shorthaired cat with grey fur and bright green eyes. I have had
        a couple other cats, Lilith, Milo, and Hobo. I like cats because they can chill, crazy, and fun all at 
        the same time. And from my experience they take way less care than dogs.</p>
    <p>
        It's an on going debate on whether cats or dogs are better, and my answer is both. Despite this 
        website being about cats, I also love dogs. When I had my cat Milo, my dog Indie, who is a
        chihuahua loved him. They got along really well and loved to play and spend time with eachother.
        All the cats that I have had love cuddling and even if they might not be pretty social, they aren't 
        mean. <span id ="word"onmouseenter="" onmouseleave="">I love cats so much!</span></p>
