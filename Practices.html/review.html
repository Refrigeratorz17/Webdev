        <p>CSP is my sixth period, and I would say one of my harder classes(which makes sense).
            Despite that, I really like the class and have learned so much about computers I never
            thought I would. I was never really interested in computers, and I never really wanted to.
            Going into this class was scary and I wasn't that excited, but as we started going i've been 
            having a lot of fun. I've learned that even if things are hard they can be fun, and that as long 
            as I try hard enough to learn, it will make enough sense for me to finish my assignments and 
            understand computers a little bit more. Some things we have learned are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>computer basics</li>
            <li>binary</li>
            <li>data compression</li>
            <li>Python programming</li>
            <li>C programming</li>
            <li>SQL</li>
            <li>The internet</li>
            <li>making websites/html</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I really like this class and have had so much fun learning and making. Ms. LaRose
            is a great teacher and her way of teaching is really easy for me to understand!
            Overall it's a great class and I'm glad i've gotten the chance to experience it! </p>
