        <h2>Growing up.</h2>
        <p>I grew up always surrounded by the arts. My mom enjoyed sketching, using reference 
            photos to recreate realistic potraits. My Aunt loved to paint, to crochet, and to draw,
            teaching me how to let my creativity loose on a paper or canvas. My other aunt would
            print me out coloring pages to teach me about colors, and so much more. I've always liked
            the way colors and different shapes could express emotions and feelings I couldn't put 
            into words. It also takes effort and creativity, showing how hard someone worked
            to make everything harmonize together. I started drawing in sketchbooks and truly trying
            to dedicate my time to art when i was around th ages of five to seven, watching videos
            and looking at references to enhance my skill. It's always fun to look back through
            my old sketchbooks and realize how far i've come. </p>

        <h2>How art has helped me.</h2>
        <p>We all go through hard times and face the troubles of life, when I went through This
            art is what helped me to figure everything out. My parents divorced when I was little and 
            since then it had seemed everything was only getting worse. From family issues, mental problems,
            and rough experiences, it had truly left an imprint in my life. When things got tough 
            art was always there to, if not help me, guide me. I would draw charcters and my interests to 
            make me happy, I would paint landscapes and experiment with different mediums to feed my 
            curiosity. I have grown quite a bit, and I have a lot more growing to do, but as of right now
            i'm happy with the way my life is, and I have art to thank for that. It taught me empathy and 
            creativity, it helped me make friends and find my emotions. This is the reason why art is so
            important to me.</p>
