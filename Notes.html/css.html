Why would you not want to use a color's name to change the color? 
    they are not specific. Not every color will render the same on other computers.
Where can you find the specific colors you want?
    using rgb, hex codes and such.

    pixels
Why would you want to set a size that automatically adjusts?
    because your window is not always the same size. so it looks good on a phone, projector,
